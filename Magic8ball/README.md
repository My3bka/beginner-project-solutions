Magic 8 Ball

    Simulate a magic 8-ball.
    Allow the user to enter their question.
    Display an in progress message(i.e. "thinking").
    Create 20 responses, and show a random response.
    Allow the user to ask another question or quit.
    Bonus:
        Add a gui.
        It must have box for users to enter the question.
        It must have at least 4 buttons:
            ask
            clear (the text box)
            play again
            quit (this must close the window)
